“Wood Apple” as a fruit has great medicinal values for those who consume it. It’s considered as a panacea for various health hazards such as improper digestion, impure blood, respiratory issues, diabetics, kidney ailments, liver health etc. Likewise “Wood Apple as a pre-school” aims to address various issues of aspecially abled child and help them develop and nurture in a safe and simulating environment. We will identify area of interest of the special kids and introduce them to the world of knowledge. If a child is not able to concentrate on his studies, obey his parents or develop his social consciousness, it does not mean that he is bad. It only means that the faculties of brain, which helps in understanding situations, retain black and white images, memories and reproduce, are less capable at that point of time though it has the potential. It needs readjustment to work efficiently. This road to efficiency is set at “Wood Apple” class rooms.
